Mock setup process:
1) Make all physical connections
  a) Place sensors in apropriate places in your grow room
  b) Connect sensors to sensor hubs
  c) Connect sensor hubs to brain
  d) Connect power moduel(s) to brain
  e) Connect camera module(s) to brain
  f) Connect ethernet, or wireless module to brain
  g) Connect power to the brain and power module(s)
2) Set up the brain
  a) Using a web browser log into your brain //This will bring you to a set up wizard to set up the connected modules
  b) Go through the set up wizard and configure all of the modules that pertain to your system //Next will be sensors
  c) Go through the wizard(s) (depending on how many sensor hubs you have configured) to configure your connected sensors/alerts
